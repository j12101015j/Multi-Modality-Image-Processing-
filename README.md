# HW1 Image Processing Project

## How to Run
1. Place the required image files (e.g., `lena.raw`, `baboon.bmp`) in the same folder as `HW1.exe`.
2. Double-click `HW1.exe`.
3. The program will automatically create an `out/` folder in the same directory and save all results inside:
   - `out/a/` for image I/O and center extraction
   - `out/b/` for point-based intensity transformations
   - `out/c/` for resampling results

## Notes
- No additional setup is required.  
- Make sure the input images are located in the same folder as `HW1.exe` before running.
